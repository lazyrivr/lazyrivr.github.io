One of the first steps to creating an HTML document is to open up TextEdit. Or Dreamweaver. Or Notepad. Or TextMate. Orâ€¦

There's no shortage of options available to you when you want to create a web page or a CSS document, so how do you know which to choose? I'll lay out some advantages and disadvantages of several major editors!

## Dreamweaver
![Dreamweaver](/images/editors/dreamweaver.png)

Dreamweaver is probably the editor you'll be spending the most time in, and for good reason! It's installed on every computer in the Spori lab, it's got some great features, and it's got FTP built in. However, it's got a few issues too.

#### Dreamweaver's Advantages:

* It's on the lab computers!
* Auto-completion of tags to save you time!
* Code highlighting, which is great to help you spot mistakes!
* FTP built in!

#### Dreamweaver's Disadvantages:

* Design view can mangle you code sometimes (though not as badly as it used to).
* To get it on your own computer, you need to subscribe to Creative Cloud, which is $20-30 a month, with a 1-year minimum.

## Sublime Text
![Sublime Text](/images/editors/sublimetext.png)

Sublime Text is one of the most common text editors in the programming community. It's small, fast, and packed to the brim with features that you'll probably never use. However, it's also got several great features that you will _love_ using when writing HTML and CSS.

#### Sublime Text's Advantages:

* Code completion to save time.
* Code highlighting with a beautiful and vibrant default theme.
* Lots of time-saving features if you take a little time to learn them.

#### Sublime Test's Disadvantages:

* It's only kind of free. It's got an unlimited trial, but it'll nag you about every 9th time you save to purchase a license. That costs $60 and there's no student discount available.

## Adobe Edge Code
![Adobe Edge Code](/images/editors/edgecode.png)

I hesitate to recommend Adobe Edge Code / Brackets at this time, but it's got some fantastic features and it's free.

Unlike most of the other text editors on this list, this one is made specifically for creating websites, and it's got some great features tailored specifically for the task. In particular, this editor can help speed up work on making your CSS.

A note about the different versions: Adobe Edge Code is Brackets with a little more polish. It's released by Adobe and has integration with their products. Brackets, however, releases a new version every 2 1/2 weeks, so they're adding great new features all the time.

#### Adobe Edge Code's Advantages:

* Code completion, code highlighting.
* Inline view of CSS, so you can quickly see what CSS is affecting a certain bit of HTML.
* Live preview of CSS edits in Chrome. Change a bit of CSS in Adobe Edge Code, see the change immediately in Google Chrome! No "save, refresh" with every change!
* New features very frequently with Brackets. New features regularly with Adobe Edge Code.

#### Adobe Edge Code's Disadvantages:

* Still in early-to-mid stages of development, so there may be bugs (though I can't think of a time I've run across any).
* Things may change. You could update, and the way something used to work may be totally different.

## TextWrangler
### Mac only
![TextWrangler](/images/editors/textwrangler.png)

TextWrangler is a pretty basic text editor, but it still has a few powerful features. It's got all the ones you'd expect from a programming text editor, but it's interface leaves a little to be desired. Sometimes I just don't know what it's different panels are doing!

#### TextWrangler's Advantages:

* Actually totally free.
* Code highlighting.
* Basic FTP features built-in (most people don't know about that part!)

#### TextWrangler's Disadvantages:

* Ugly, confusing interface.
* No code completion.

## Notepad++
### Windows only
![Notepad++](/images/editors/notepadplusplus.png)

Notepad++ is my recommendation for a super-basic editor on Windows. It doesn't have a ton of features, but it also stays out of your way and just lets you code. Especially helpful: it's tabbed interface. Nothing's worse than a million windows floating around!

#### Notepad++'s Advantages:

* Code highlighting.
* Tabs to keep things neat.
* Truly free!

#### Notepad++'s Disadvantages:

* No code completion.
* Any features not mentioned are ones you'll probably never use.

## Other Editors

There are other editors out there, even some I would recommend, but these are my top picks. There are some that look really slick, but have expensive price tags. There are others that have some great features (like info about HTML tags), but are slow and overly-complicated. The picks I've made provide a good balance of features, speed, and price.

I would recommend trying out a few of the editors as you work on the first few assignments and see which ones you like. You won't know until you try!
