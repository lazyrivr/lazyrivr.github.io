# HTML & CSS for Confused Students

### I know. Learning HTML and CSS are incredibly difficult. Where do you even begin?

I'm here to help. My name is Andy Bell, and I've been where you're at, to a certain extent anyway. I've been dabbling with HTML and CSS since the early 2000s, but I didn't really get into it until I took COMM 310 at BYU-Idaho from [Brother Judkins](http://www.brotherjudkins.com) in the Fall of 2012.

Since January 2013, I've been a lab assistant in the Comm Department lab, and since February 2013 I have been the tutor for COMM 310 at the [Tutoring Center](http://www.byui.edu/tutoringcenter).

Long story short, I've helped dozens of students just like you as they've struggled through COMM 310. In that time, I've picked up a few ideas on how to help you succeed, so click on one of the topics to dive in!
