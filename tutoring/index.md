As much as I'd love to say that I'm doing this all out of the goodness of my own heart, I can't say that. I'm making this site because I see the same questions come up over and over, and I see things that students struggle with in tutoring that they don't even realize there's a solution for!

One solution to help you if you're struggling with COMM 310 at BYU-Idaho is to sign up for a tutoring session. You get one hour of complete one-on-one* time to ask any questions you've got and have me help you through your assignment or project. You'd be surprised at what you can learn and what you can accomplish with one hour spent at your own pace!

(* most tutoring sessions are one-on-one, but sometimes if it's an especially busy time it may need to be a group session)

## What to Expect

What can you expect during a tutoring session? It's going to be different every time because tutoring sessions are powered by *you*! We'll work on whatever benefits you most during the hour. If you're struggling with HTML, we'll focus on HTML. If you are having trouble knowing where to begin on a project, I can help you get started on the right foot! I can even guide you to resources that will help you out when you're working on your project on your own later. Tutoring sessions are what you make of them!

## How to Prepare

Tutoring appointments are most effective, productive, and fun if you come prepared! You'll want to bring a few things to your tutoring appointment:

* Your computer. The campus labs are usually too busy, especially the one in the Spori building.
* Your assignment/project. Whatever you're working on, you're going to want to bring it with you. (You shouldn't be saving stuff only onto the lab computers anyway. That's a bad idea.)
* Your questions. As I [said above](#what_to_expect), tutoring sessions are powered by you. Your questions make the session great!

The other thing I would say you really need to do before a tutoring appointment is try your best. I know it's a hard class and there's a lot to learn, but the teachers really are great and there are a ton of great resources on the internet to help you out! I'm not saying don't come in (I really like my paycheck), but I am saying that you can do more than you think you can! Also, the assignments and projects for this class will take longer to do than you think they will, so be sure to not procrastinate! Procrastination can lead to some pretty stressful tutoring appointments!

## How to Sign Up

If you want a guide with pictures, click here! (coming soon)

Signing up for a tutoring session is pretty easy. Just do the following steps:

1. Go to the [tutoring center website](http://www.byui.edu/tutoringcenter).
2. Click on "Tutor Request" in the left-hand sidebar.
3. Sign in with your BYU-Idaho username and password.
4. Click on "Search Availability" on the left side of the page.
5. On the left you'll see the search criteria. First, choose "TUTORING." Then select the class/section. Then click search!
6. Click on one of the available time slots that works for you.
7. *This is important!* In the comments field, enter your questions or what you're struggling with. This helps me prepare for the appointment better!
8. Click save and look for the appointment confirmation in your email!

Unfortunately, the tutor scheduling system sometimes doesn't work. Or maybe none of the times listed work for you. No worries! [Email me](mailto:bel07012@byui.edu) and we can work something out. For my own sanity, I don't put every hour I'm available into the scheduling system, so we can almost certainly find something that works!
